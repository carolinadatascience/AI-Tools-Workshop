In this workshop we'll go over different ways that we can leverage AI (specificially, Generative AI) to help us along the data science process. This is a workshop that welcomes all skill levels and experiences. Python experience may help, but no coding experience is required!
## Getting Started

To follow along with the workshop, open up the blank notebook version in Google Colab. This will allow you to follow along with the "coding" portion as we go. Alternatively, you can open up the full notebook which has all the completed code. Opening up these notebooks in Google Colab will be best for this workshop as we'll be using Colab's AI assistant!
